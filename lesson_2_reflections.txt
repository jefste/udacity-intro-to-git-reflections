How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where the information about the files is stored that is to be 
committed. The working directory contains all the files in the current directory 
and the repository contains only files that have been committed. 
It does add value in that it allows you to add multiple files to a single commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

It insures that you have the appropriate number of files,  whether it be one 
file or several files. You can also make sure that you don't have more than
one file or one logical change if you can view what is in the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

If you want to add a new feature that might break the current program, then you 
would be able to revert back to the master branch. Keeping the master branch in
tact would be important to keep the program still useable. Additionally, 
using branches might make it clearer about what changes are being made to the 
program.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams allow you to easily see which commits are in each branch.
