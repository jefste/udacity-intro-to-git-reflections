How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where the information about the files is stored that is to be 
committed. The working directory contains all the files in the current directory 
and the repository contains only files that have been committed. 
It does add value in that it allows you to add multiple files to a single commit.
