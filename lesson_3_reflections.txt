When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

It would be useful to have the work on a remote repository to be able to 
collaborate with others on a project as well as allow you work on different 
computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to pull manually because someone might have modified the remote
repository that could break the code that you are currently working on.
